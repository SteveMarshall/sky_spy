Sky Spy
=======
Perl scripts for monitoring network status on Sky Broadband routers.

Work in progress
----------------
This is still a work in progress and a little rough around the edges.
Documentation is lacking.

Rationale
---------
You would use Sky Spy if:

* you have issues with your Sky Broadband connection, and would like to
  diagnose the problem, or gather evidence to present to tech support.
* you would like to keep an eye on your network for some other reason.

Installing
